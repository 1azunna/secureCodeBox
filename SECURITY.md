# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Our _release cycle_ for new features (minior [semver](https://semver.org/lang/de/) update)
is roughly every two weeks (we will usually make a new release after each review). 

| Version | Security Fixes* | Supported** |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| 2.6.x-alpha1 | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| 2.5.x | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| <= 2.4.x | :x: | :x: |
| < 2.0 | :x: | :x: |

### Major Release (Semver)
_Upcoming major updates_ will come with a time window in which both _major versions_ (starting with v2.x.x)
will receive security updates and bugfixes. The concrete support intervall will be probably a couple of months
and will be published when the next major version will be released.

### Minor Release/Feature Releases (Semver)
We currently plan to provide support for the _latest minor [semver](https://semver.org/lang/de/)_ release only.

### Patch Release/Bugfix/Security Fix
We try to make bugfixes and high severity fixes available as patch release for the current minor release
as early as possible.
